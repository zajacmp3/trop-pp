        <h1>Privacy Policy for TROP</h1>
        <p class="meta"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 23, 2025</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>TROP (Tactical Reconnaissance Operations Platform) is a moving maps and situational awareness application for Android devices. This privacy policy explains what information the app accesses, how it is used, and how your privacy is protected.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Developer Information</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Developer:</strong> DefenceBay</li>
                <li><strong>App Name:</strong> TROP</li>
                <li><strong>Package Name:</strong> com.defencebay.trop.map</li>
                <li><strong>Contact:</strong> biuro@mzeds.pl</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>TROP does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data with the app developer (DefenceBay).</strong> All data processed by the application remains on your device or is transmitted only to servers that you explicitly configure (such as TAK Servers).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Information Accessed by TROP</h2>
            <p>TROP requires various permissions to provide its mapping and situational awareness functionality. Here's what we access and why:</p>

            <h3>Location Services</h3>

                <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> Location data is stored locally on your device and optionally transmitted to TAK Servers you configure</li>
                <li><strong>Background Access:</strong> Required to maintain location tracking when the app is minimized, essential for situational awareness applications</li>
            </ul>

                <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> All files remain on your device unless you explicitly share them</li>
            </ul>

            </ul>

                <li><strong>Necessity:</strong> These permissions are essential for a situational awareness application that must operate continuously</li>
            </ul>

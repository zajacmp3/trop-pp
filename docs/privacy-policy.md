- DefenceBay has no access to or control over TAK Servers you configure

### Map Tile Servers

- Map servers may log IP addresses and tile requests according to their own privacy policies
- You can use TROP entirely offline with cached map data

All data processed by TROP is stored locally on your device. You can delete any data at any time by:
- Clearing app data in Android Settings > Apps > TROP > Storage > Clear Data
- Uninstalling the application
- Manually deleting files from the TROP directory on your device storage

## Children's Privacy

TROP is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children. The app is designed for professional and tactical use by adults.

## Security

TROP implements security features including:
- Support for encrypted connections to TAK Servers (SSL/TLS)

Being open source means:
- The code can be audited for privacy and security
- There are no hidden data collection mechanisms
- Community contributions improve the software

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

DefenceBay does not share, sell, or disclose any user data because we do not collect any user data. All data remains on your device or is transmitted only to services you explicitly configure.

We may disclose information only if required by law or to protect the safety of users or others, though we maintain minimal data that could be subject to such requests.
